### Getting Started

**NOTE: Documentation on master branch is for alpha version, stable release is on [master](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/)**

```sh
yarn add -D @storybook/addon-notes
```

Then create a file called `addons.js` in your storybook config.

Add following content to it:

```js
import "@storybook/addon-notes/register"
```

You can use the `notes` parameter to add a note to each story:

```js
import { storiesOf } from "@storybook/react"

import Component from "./Component"

storiesOf("Component", module).add("with some emoji", () => <Component />, {
  notes: "A very simple example of addon notes"
})
```

#### Using Markdown

To use markdown in your notes is supported, storybook will load markdown as raw by default.

```js
import { storiesOf } from "@storybook/react"
import Component from "./Component"
import notes from "./someMarkdownText.md"

storiesOf("Component", module).add("With Markdown", () => <Component />, {
  notes
})
```
